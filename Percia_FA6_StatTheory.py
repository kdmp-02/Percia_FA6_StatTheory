# #### Number 2
# 
# (5 points). On a final examination in statistics, the mean grade of a group of 150 students was 78 and the standard deviation was 8.0. In algebra, however, the mean final grade of the group was 73 and the standard deviation was 7.6. In which subject was there the greater (a) absolute dispersion and (b) relative dispersion?

# In[2]:


mean_stats = 78
std_stats = 8

mean_algebra = 73
std_algebra = 7.6

#The absolute dispersion is the standard deviation itself

absolute_dispersion = {
    'Statistics': [std_stats],
    'Algebra': [std_algebra],
}

#The relative distribution is the coefficient of variation

cv_stats = (std_stats/mean_stats) * 100
cv_algebra = (std_algebra/mean_algebra) * 100

relative_dispersion = {
    'Statistics (CV%)': [cv_stats],
    'Algebra (CV%)': [cv_algebra]
}

whole_data = {'Subject' : ['Statistics', 'Algebra'],
             'Mean' : [78, 73],
             'Absolute Dispersion' : [std_stats, std_algebra],
             'Relative Dispersion': [cv_stats, cv_algebra]}

# #### Number 3
# 
# (10 points). Prove that the mean and standard deviation of a set of standard scores are equal to 0 and 1, respectively. Use the following problem to illustrate this: Convert the set 6, 2, 8, 7, 5 into standard scores

# In[3]:


from scipy.stats import zscore

data = [6, 2, 8, 7 ,5]

z_scores = zscore(data)

z_mean = np.round(np.mean(z_scores), decimals = 10)
z_std = np.round(np.std(z_scores), decimals = 10)

table = {'Set of Scores' : data,
        'Standard Scores' : z_scores}

df2 = pd.DataFrame(table)
display(df2)

print(f"The mean of a set of standard scores is : {z_mean:.2f}")
print(f"The standard deviation of a set of standard scores is : {z_std:.2f}")


# ##### Explanation
# 
# - 'zscore()' converts raw scroes in to a standard scores.
# - By the given example above, this proves that z-scores will always have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. (Look below that using a random generator numbers will have the same result)

# In[4]:


np.random.seed(42)

rand = np.random.randint(1, 101, size=20)

rz_scores = zscore(rand)

rz_mean =  np.round(np.mean(rz_scores), decimals = 10)
rz_std = np.round(np.std(rz_scores), decimals = 10)

print("Is mean of the standard scores equal to zero?")
print(rz_mean == 0)

print("Is standard deviation of the standard scores equal to one?")
print(rz_std == 1)


# #### Number 4
# 
# (5 points). Three masses are measured as 20.48, 35.97, and 62.34 g, with standard deviations of 0.21, 0.46, and 0.54 g, respectively. Find the (a) mean and (b) standard deviation of the sum of the masses.

# In[5]:


masses = [20.48, 35.97, 62.34]
std_devs = [0.21 , 0.46, 0.54]

mean_sum = np.sum(masses)/3

std_sum = np.sqrt(np.sum(np.square(std_devs)))

print(f"The mean of the sum of the masses : {mean_sum:.2f}")
print(f"The standard deviation of the sum of the masses : {std_sum:.2f}")


# #### Number 5

# (10 points). The credit hour distribution at Metropolitan Technological College is as follows:
